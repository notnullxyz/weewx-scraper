# weewx-scraper
Intended for a very specific use here... this scrapes some values from my own weewx install (in my case BelcherTown skin). Quick HTML and JS here.

Will this work for you? Probably. 
# point it towards your weewx site
# make sure you allow the cors, etc stuff
# if it doesn't, it could be the weewx skin you're using (I use BelcherTown)

It's silly to scrape data if you can access an API, especially if your station is pushing to WU/WC/EcoWitt etc
Just use those. I created this for a very specific situation and use on a display that can only display certain things out here...
